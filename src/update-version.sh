# This is a simple script that tries to extract the current git commit
# using "git describe" and write it to a generated source file (so it
# can be accessed and logged from the GSP).
#
# If this cannot be done, e.g. because we have a non-git source tree from
# a released distribution archive, then the file is left alone (and should
# already be there with the release version in it).
#
# This command expects one or more arguments.  If the output matches any
# of the listed files already, nothing is done.  Else the new version data
# is written to the first argument.
